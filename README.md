# File-Hash-Checker

We check the source hash with the hash of current file using the path using two popular hashing Algorithms i.e MD5 and SHA-256
This helps to validate and authenticate the integrity of downloaded files.

We import the haslib module and os module to get access to generate different hashes and to locate and get access to
different files located in the local storage.
